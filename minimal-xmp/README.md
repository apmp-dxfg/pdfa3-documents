# Example of setting XMP metadata

The LaTeX file `ex_xmp.tex` shows how metadata may be attributed to the XMP code stored in a PDF/A file.
The document title and author are stored in this example.

Two Python scripts (`ex_xmp.py` and `ex_xmp_2.py`) are provided, showing how metadata may be read by different Python packages.
