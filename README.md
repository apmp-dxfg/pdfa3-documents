# pdfa3-documents
To assist in the production of PDF/A-3 documents for metrological reports, these pages contain examples using LaTeX.

A calibration report style (LaTeX class) for a fictitious metrology institute is developed. 
This enables metrologists to create calibration reports with a harmonised appearance and to embed digital files (e.g., spreadsheets) as required.

More detail about these examples is available on APMP-DXFG [resources](https://apmp-dxfg.org/dxfg-pdfa-tut) pages.
